    "This step will help you determine data preparation and feature engineering techniques you will need to apply to your data to build a balanced modeling data set for your problem and model. These data preparation techniques may include:\n",
    "* addressing missingness, such as replacing missing values with means\n",
    "* renaming features and labels\n",
    "* finding and replacing outliers\n",
    "* performing winsorization if needed\n",
    "* performing one-hot encoding on categorical features\n",
    "* performing vectorization for an NLP problem\n",
    "* addressing class imbalance in your data sample to promote fair AI\n",

    "Think of the different techniques you have used to inspect and analyze your data in this course. These include using Pandas to apply data filters, using the Pandas `describe()` method to get insight into key statistics for each column, using the Pandas `dtypes` property to inspect the data type of each column, and using Matplotlib and Seaborn to detect outliers and visualize relationships between features and labels. If you are working on a classification problem, use techniques you have learned to determine if there is class imbalance.\n",
